Go with the categorized multi-select dropdown - it maintains your current layout while solving the scalability problem elegantly.
 
I've created an interactive prototype of the approval modal with a categorized multi-select dropdown. Here are the key features:
Key Features:
Searchable dropdown - Type to instantly filter across all departments
Collapsible categories - Click category headers to expand/collapse
Select All/Deselect All - Quick actions per category
Visual feedback - Shows count of selected items per category
Selected tags - Displays first 6 selected departments as removable chips below
Clear All - Quick option to deselect everything
Smooth interactions - Hover effects and transitions throughout
User Flow:
Click the dropdown to open
Search or browse by category
Select individual departments or use "Select All" for a category
See selections as tags below
Click X on tags to quickly remove selections
Try interacting with it - search for departments, expand/collapse categories, and select multiple items. This approach scales well and keeps your modal clean while handling all 38 departments efficiently!
